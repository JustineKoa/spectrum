# Spectrum :left_right_arrow: 
> Started during SB Hacks 2021 :smile:

## What does Spectrum do? :thinking:
Spectrum allows groups (sizes 2-10) to join private rooms with each other and converse about fun and meaningful topics via video chat embedded into our application. Spectrum handles the topics and gives each person the opportunity to speak. The current speaker in the room has the capability to change the prompt or pass on the speaker role to another person in the room, chosen randomly by Spectrum. When hopping on the application, you have the option to create and name your own room, or join an existing one! Once entering the room, you are placed in the lobby where every user is assigned a cute avatar to represent them on the spectrum! In the lobby, you can wait for more participants or start the activity. Once the activity is started, a random first speaker and topic are chosen and the conversation may begin! :speech_balloon:
